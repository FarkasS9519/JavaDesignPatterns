     * Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class
     * and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the java virtual machine.
     *
     * Singleton pattern is used for logging, drivers objects, caching and thread pool.
     *
     * Common concepts:
     *     - Private constructor to restrict instantiation of the class from other classes.
     *     - Private static variable of the same class that is the only instance of the class.
     *     - Public static method that returns the instance of the class, this is the global
     *       access point for outer world to get the instance of the singleton class.
